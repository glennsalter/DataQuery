# Data Query Task
## Basic setup
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate # On Windows use .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Approach #1 - Web Scraping
This approach uses `selenium` to scrape the announcement page.

Command:
```bash
python webscraper.py
```
Output files found in `output` folder:
- `{timestamp}_announcements.csv` - CSV file containing the announcements data.

Should look like:
```
title

## Approach #2 - API
Command:
```bash
python apirequest.py --refresh_rate 60
```

Explanation:
- This script will use `selenium` to open the binance website to get the `cookies`.
- Once we get the cookies it is used to make API requests

Benefits:
- This speeds up the process as we don't have to open the browser for every request
